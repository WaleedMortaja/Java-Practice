/*
P2.4 The intersection method computes the intersection of two rectanglesâ€”that is, the
rectangle that would be formed by two overlapping rectangles if they were drawn, as
shown at right.
You call this method as follows:
Rectangle r3 = r1.intersection(r2);
Write a program IntersectionPrinter that constructs two
rectangle objects, prints them as described in Exercise P2.1,
and then prints the rectangle object that describes the
intersection. Then the program should print the result of the
intersection method when the rectangles do not overlap.
Add a comment to your program that explains how you can
tell whether the resulting rectangle is empty.
