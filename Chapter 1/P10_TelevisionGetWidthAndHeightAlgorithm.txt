A television manufacturer advertises that a television
set has a certain size, measured diagonally.
You wonder how the set will fit into your living
room. Write an algorithm that yields the horizontal
and vertical size of the television. Your inputs are
the diagonal size and the aspect ratio (the ratio of
width to height, usually 16 : 9 for television sets).

The answer:
1. Enter the inputs (the diagonal size and the aspect ratio).
2. Calculate the angle theta  using tan inverse and aspect ratio = atan(height/width)
3. Width = diagonal size * cos(theta)
4. Height = diagonal size * sin(theta)
5. print the outputs (Width and Height).
